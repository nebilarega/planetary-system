        planet in the solar system and takes around 88 days to complete 
        one revolution (to be exact 88.97 days) which is the smallest time duration.\n
        Its size is slightly larger than the size of the moon of earth. 
        It does not have many moons and climatic conditions that are not favorable for any form of life as it is too near to the Sun. 
        Its surface temperature ranges from 100 K at night to 700 K during the day (this high diurnal range of 
        temperature is there because the planet has no atmosphere to retain and this is the highest among all planets).`,

        It rotates in the opposite direction to all planets except Uranus (from West to East).\n
        It’s also observed that one day on Venus is equal to one year on Earth. 
        It’s also called Earth’s twin sister because of its similar size, shape,
        mass, and proximity to the sun and of its bulky composition. It’s not suitable 
        for human settlement because it contains 96% carbon in the atmosphere. 
        The surface temperature is very high (a mean temperature of 735K), making it the warmest planet in our solar system.`,

        It takes 365.264 days to complete one revolution around the Sun and 24 hours to complete one rotation on its axis (and after every four complete revolutions 4years it takes a day longer 366 days to complete a revolution). 
        It is covered by 71% of water and its crust is divided into different tectonic plates (lithosphere). Earth’s innermost part remains active and its inner core is solid while the outer core is liquid which generates Earth's magnetic field.`,
